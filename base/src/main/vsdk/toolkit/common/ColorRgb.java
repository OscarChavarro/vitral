/**
Respect to data representation:

The `r`, `g`, and `b` class attributes represent red, green and blue 
components in a color specification, with values in the range [0, inf) when
used in High Dynamic Range Imaginary (HDRI). Note that no restriction as been
specified regarding units to be used, and as of this revision the units
must be application defined. When not used in HDRI, the values must be
application-clamped to the range [0, 1]. A value of 0 always will represent
'no contribution' or 'black', and a value of 1 will be 'white' in non HDRI
applications. Interpretation in HDRI applications is pending to be defined.
