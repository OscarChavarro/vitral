/**
The Calligraphic2DBuffer class represents a set of elements suitable for a
vector graphics device, like calligraphic CRT, vectorized postscript
and conventional/legacy pen-plotters.

This class is to calligraphic devices like the Image class is to raster
devices.

The nature of this class is structurally 2D, so must not be treated as a
Geometry as doesn't live in 3D space. Nevertheless, could be used as an
argument or modifier for 3D Geometry, in the same way an Image could be
used as a map (i.e. texture or colormap, depthmap, bumpmap, etc).

This class doesn't impose any interpretation on coordinates, but it is
suggested that internal double coordinates be mapped to the range
<-1, -1, -1> to <1, 1, 1>.
