/**
The RGBProceduralColorPalette abstract class provides an interface for
procedural color palette classes. This serves two purposes:
  - To help in design level organization of procedural color palettes
    (this eases the study of the class hierarchy)
  - To provide a place to locate operations and methods, common to all
    procedural color palette classes.

Note that any procedural color palette is a normal color palette. Its
difference is that some operations (most notably the selectNearestIndexToRgb
method) are more rapidly calculated in some procedural defined palettes that
its normal method.
