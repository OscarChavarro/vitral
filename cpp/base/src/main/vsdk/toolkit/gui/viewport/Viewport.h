/**
A `Viewport` is one rectangular area of a `ViewportSet`, showing the scene
through one of its cameras. It is a plain model object: it knows nothing about
the GUI or rendering technology used to present it. It owns its cameras and
its renderer configuration.

The area occupied is specified in two ways:
  - As percentages of the containing `ViewportSet` area (`startXPercent`,
    `startYPercent`, `sizeXPercent`, `sizeYPercent`), assigned by the layout
    of the `ViewportSet`. Origin is at the lower left corner of the container.
  - As pixels (`pixelStartX`, `pixelStartY`, `pixelSizeX`, `pixelSizeY`),
    calculated from the percentages by `updatePixelArea`. A viewport can
    request an specific size in pixels. If this size gets smaller than the
    percent-based area, the viewport is assigned to match the requested size,
    centered inside the percent-based area. If a requested size dimension is
    greater than the percent-based area, the requested size is ignored. A
    requested size of 0 means the requested size matches the percent-based
    size. This is useful in applications willing to use just a subset of the
    area, for example when previewing slow raytracing visualizations.
