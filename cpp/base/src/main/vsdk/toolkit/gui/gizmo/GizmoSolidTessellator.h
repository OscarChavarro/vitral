/**
Tessellates, in world space, the simple solids the gizmos are built with (the
shafts and heads of their axes, the small cubes at their tips and their plane
handles), so the technology-dependent renderers only have to send the resulting
points to the rasterizer.

Each element of a gizmo is a `SimpleBody` whose geometry is expressed in
its own local frame, and grows along its local +Z (see
`localTransform(SimpleBody*)`); every method here receives that local
frame as a matrix and returns points already transformed by it.

The primitives returned follow these conventions:

- A *strip* is a sequence of points for a triangle strip.
- A *fan* is a sequence of points for a triangle fan, with its center or apex
  as the first point.
