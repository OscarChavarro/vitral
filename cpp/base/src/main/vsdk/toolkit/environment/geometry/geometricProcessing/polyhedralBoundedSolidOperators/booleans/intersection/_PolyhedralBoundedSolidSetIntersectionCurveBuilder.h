/**
Reconstructs the intersection curves of a boolean set operation from the
paired null-edge lists `sonea`/`soneb` produced by the classify stage
([MANT1988].15.6), before the connect stage ([MANT1988].15.7) consumes them.

The intersection of the boundaries of two closed 2-manifolds is a set of
closed space polylines. Between two consecutive intersection points the curve
runs along the intersection line of one specific pair (faceA, faceB), so two
paired null edges are candidate neighbors on a curve if and only if they
share at least one face of A and at least one face of B. When more than two
points lie on the same face pair, the chord structure is recovered by sorting
along the planes' intersection direction `dir = nA x nB` and pairing
entry/exit points by parity.

The resulting report orders each closed curve (cycle) as the connect stage
requires, and exposes structural anomalies: open chains, isolated nodes
(tangential grazing contacts) and pinch nodes (figure-8 cusps).

C++ counterpart of Java's `_PolyhedralBoundedSolidSetIntersectionCurveBuilder`.
