/**
This is a utility class containing a lot of geometry examples (mostly
geometry generating procedures). This is a companion class for the
`ComputationalGeometry` and `GeometricModeler` classes, which holds
geometrical queries and other geometry generation procedures.

This class comprises static methods, depending on only of Vitral's Entity's.
From a design point of view, it can be viewed as a "strategy" design pattern
in the sense that encapsulates algorithms. It also could be viewed as a "factory"
or "abstract factory", as it is a class for creating objects, following
the data hierarchy of interface "geometry".

An important characteristic of this class is that the simple geometries that
creates, are usually "inspired" (or "borrowed") from classic textbooks and
papers from the computer graphics academic community. Most of the methods
contain references to figures and other data published by original authors.

The simple geometry test object provided here are useful because:
  - They are procedurally generated. That means that no input/output is used.
    This is useful in developing environments where input/output is not
    available, or where its operation is not ported yet (for example mobile
    devices), so this class can be used for testing Vitral software
    infrastructure, before input/output operation are made available.
  - For algorithm benchmarking. Usually, original authors has invented
    this simple test objects for testing algorithms and measuring its
    performance.  When reimplementing the original algorithms in Vitral,
    running them with similar test objects is useful when comparing
    Vitral's implementation performance.

C++ port note: only the objects that do not need the boolean pipeline of
[MANT1988] chapters 14 and 15 (splitter, set operator) are ported, as it is
not available in the C++ port yet (see `PolyhedralBoundedSolidModeler`).
