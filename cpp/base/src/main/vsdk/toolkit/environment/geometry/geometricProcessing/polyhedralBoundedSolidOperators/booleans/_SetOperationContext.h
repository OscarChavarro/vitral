Per-invocation mutable state for one boolean set-operation: the Mantyla
"son*" globals from program [MANT1988].15.1 (sonvv, sonva, sonvb, sonea,
soneb, sonfa, sonfb). One instance is threaded explicitly through the
pipeline (generate -> classify -> connect -> finish) so the lists are not
shared static fields.

The numeric tolerance context and the id namespace are intentionally left as
managed static state in `_PolyhedralBoundedSolidOperator`; only the
per-operation list state is carried here.

C++ counterpart of Java's `_SetOperationContext`.
