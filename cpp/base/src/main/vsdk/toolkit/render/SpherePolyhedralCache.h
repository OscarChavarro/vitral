/**
Tessellation cache shared by the `*SphereRenderer`s of every rendering
technology (OpenGL1, OpenGL4, software...), independent of all of them.

A `Sphere` is kept by its renderers as a parametric surface; to draw it, it is
converted, in code, into a `PolyhedralBoundedSolid` with the parametric
construction of `Sphere::exportToPolyhedralBoundedSolid(meridians, parallels)`,
and that solid is the cached representation: besides being drawn by the
rasterizers, it can be used by other drawing algorithms that are not
OpenGL based (hidden line removal, software renderers...), which a plain mesh
does not allow.

For the rasterizers, each entry also derives from the (triangular) faces of
the solid the per vertex attributes a smooth, textured and bump mapped sphere
needs, which the faceted solid does not carry: for each vertex, its spherical
coordinates (theta, phi) are recovered from its position, and the normal,
tangent and binormal are evaluated on the parametric surface
(`Sphere::sphereNormal`, `sphereTangent`, `sphereBinormal`), with texture
coordinates (1 - theta / (2 PI), (phi + PI / 2) / PI). Along the seam of the
parametrization (theta = 0) the texture coordinates of a triangle are made
continuous, and at the poles (where theta is undefined) the vertex takes the
mean theta of the other corners of its triangle.

Entries are kept by radius and resolution, so many spheres of a scene share
them. Entries are owned by the cache: a pointer obtained from it is valid
until the next `clear()` or until the cache empties itself when full.
