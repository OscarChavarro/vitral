Reads the shared, ordered dialog definitions (`etc/gui/dialogs.json`)
without toolkit dependencies, as `DialogPersistence` in the Java and
TypeScript ports: each dialog becomes a `WidgetDialog` of the GUI context,
with its title key, its modality and its `WidgetDialogElement`s.

The definitions are validated as in Java: schema version 1, unique dialog
and element identifiers, known element kinds, and the bindings and actions
each kind needs. Failures are `IllegalArgumentException` exceptions with the
messages of the Java `IllegalArgumentException`s.

C++ port note: it takes the JSON text instead of an `InputStream`, and
reads it with its own small JSON reader (the C++ toolkit has no JSON
library).
