/**
Robust geometric predicates over a {@link PolyhedralBoundedSolid}: discrete
in/out queries whose combinatorial answer is correct and consistent even at
degenerate configurations (a point exactly on a face boundary, a ray entering
through a shared edge or coplanar with a face).

<p>Degeneracies are the source of the residual errors in the Appel hidden-line
quantitative invisibility ([APPE1967]) on axis-aligned solids. A single finite
perturbation (jitter/tilt) is non-degenerate for some configurations and grazing
for others, so it cannot be robust. Following the spirit of Simulation of
Simplicity ([EDEL1990]) this class resolves degeneracies by choosing, per query,
a probe direction in <em>general position</em> with respect to the actual faces:
a face hit classified {@code LIMIT} (on the polygon boundary) flags that the
current probe grazes, and the query is retried with the next generic direction
until a clean one is found. Degeneracies are measure zero per direction, so a
clean probe is found almost immediately.

<p>Inputs and the solid geometry are in the solid's own (object/local)
coordinate system; callers that work in world space (e.g. the renderer through
{@code SimpleBody}) must transform the query point into object space first.

<p>This is a query layer; it does not modify the solid.

<p><b>Scope.</b> Provides the robust point-in-solid keystone
({@link #isPointInside}) and, built on it, the robust hidden-line quantitative
invisibility ({@link #quantitativeInvisibility}). The renderer uses the latter:
{@code PolyhedralBoundedSolid.computeQuantitativeInvisibility} delegates here, and
these methods reuse that solid's per-frame plane/AABB snapshot
({@code beginVisibilityQueries}) for performance.

    as seen from `eye`: the number of front-facing surface elements strictly
    between the eye and the point — equivalently the number of times the STRAIGHT
    line of sight enters the solid INTERIOR before reaching the point.

    <p>Robust by construction, with no perturbation of the line of sight: the
    segment is split at every boundary crossing (captured tolerantly, so an
    edge/vertex graze becomes an interval boundary) and each interval midpoint is
    classified as strictly interior, strictly outside, or ON the surface (a
    midpoint lying on a face — the line of sight runs along the surface there,
    e.g. coplanar with a face). Only entries into a strictly-interior run count.
    A line of sight tangent to the silhouette merely touches the boundary (its
    neighbouring intervals are outside) and a coplanar one runs ON the surface,
    so neither fabricates an occluder — the two degeneracies that defeat a
    finite-perturbation jitter/tilt. The interior/outside decision delegates to
    the robust {@link #isPointInside}; the on-surface decision is an explicit
    in-plane / in-face test.

    <p>`point` is on the surface, so the target is pulled a small step back toward
